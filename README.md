# Bot Documentation

## Overview
This bot is a Python-based application designed to run a web server. It uses Flask as the web framework and includes various modules for handling routes, logic, and data processing. The application is structured into multiple directories for better organization, including `app/` for the main application logic, `code/` for additional utilities, and `templates/` for HTML files.

## Prerequisites
Before running the bot, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Python 3.13 or higher**
2. **pip** (Python package manager)
3. **Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd bot
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended)
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure all required Python packages are installed. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   If a `requirements.txt` file is not present, manually install Flask:
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

4. **Run the Application**
   Start the Flask server by executing the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   The server will run in debug mode by default and can be accessed at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## File Structure

### Root Directory
- `main.py`: Entry point for the application. Starts the Flask server.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

### `app/` Directory
- `__init__.py`: Initializes the `app` module.
- `routes.py`: Defines the routes for the web application, linking URLs to specific functions.
- `tickers.txt`: A text file for storing ticker data.
- `csv/`: Contains CSV files generated by the application.
  - `oversold.csv`: Stores data for oversold tickers.
  - `overbought.csv`: Stores data for overbought tickers.
- `secrets/`: Contains sensitive information.
  - `secrets.yaml`: Stores API keys and secrets used by the application.
- `static/`: Contains static files like CSS.
  - `styles.css`: Stylesheet for the web application.
- `templates/`: HTML templates for rendering web pages.
  - `index.html`: Homepage of the application.
  - `csv_view.html`: Displays CSV data in a web view.
  - `oversold.html`: Page for oversold tickers.
  - `overbought.html`: Page for overbought tickers.

### `code/` Directory
- `bitvavo.py`: Handles interactions with the Bitvavo API.
- `indicators.py`: Contains logic for fetching and calculating technical indicators.

## Running the Application

To run the application, execute the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Example Usage
1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
2. Use the homepage to interact with the app. For example:
   - View oversold tickers at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/oversold`.
   - View overbought tickers at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/overbought`.
3. Check the generated CSV files in the `app/csv/` directory for detailed data.

## Notes
- Ensure the `tickers.txt` file exists in the `app/` directory before running the application.
- Debug mode is enabled by default for development purposes. Disable it in production by setting `debug=False` in `main.py`.

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter issues with missing packages, ensure all dependencies are installed.
